int main (){
    int i=3;

        printf("%d\n",i);
        i++;

    return 0;
}
// Output:
// 3    
// 4
// 5
// Explanation: The loop starts with i=3 and continues as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
// Each iteration prints the current value of i and then increments it by 1.

// Note: This code is written in C17 standard as specified.
// The code demonstrates the use of a WHILE loop to print numbers from 3 to 5.
// The loop will execute as long as the condition (i <= 5) is true.
// The loop will print the values 3, 4, and 5 on separate lines.
// The loop stops when i becomes 6, which does not satisfy the condition anymore.
// The code is self-contained and can be compiled and run in any standard C environment.
